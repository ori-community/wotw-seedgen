// Notes on a concept that I don't want to implement right now
// Instead of generating all possible solutions, and later choosing a random one, we could make random choices along the way
// For instance, a damage requirement could choose to solve with resilience 10% of the time (and communicate the result to all further damage requirements in the chain)
// We would then only follow through on that choice, and optimally keep working on just one solutions throughout the requirement chain
// The catch with this is that not all solutions are practical, the available item slots and pool eliminate anywhere between none and all solutions
// If we ever arrive at a point where the constraints eliminate the solution we're working on, we would have to pivot to another solution
// We'd still need to remember entry points that can potentially generate all possible solutions, but we could do so lazily
// Worst-case (no solution is practical) we still go through all the options, this could be mitigated by exiting out of impractical solutions as early as possible
// But in many cases this could significantly improve performance when choosing solutions
